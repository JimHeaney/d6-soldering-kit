# D6 Soldering Kit

## Overview
The D6 Soldering Kit is a simple and fun soldering kit, that teaches those new to soldering about LEDs, microcontrollers, and random number generators. Once complete, the D6 can be shaken to generate a random number between 1 and 6. 

When no longer needed, the AtTiny can be harvested from the D6 and re-used for other projects.
